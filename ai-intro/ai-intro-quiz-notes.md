## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?

### Human answer

> Not really. AI cannot think yet (not yet). AI will not take our jobs, but the ones who know AI will.

### AI (ChatGPT) answer

> AI has made significant advancements in automating many aspects of software development, such as generating code, debugging, and optimizing. However, it's unlikely that AI will fully replace software developers anytime soon. While AI can assist with repetitive tasks and enhance productivity, human creativity, problem-solving, and understanding of user needs are essential in software development. Developers will still play a crucial role in designing systems, making architectural decisions, and interpreting business requirements.

AI can complement developers by handling some of the more mundane tasks, allowing developers to focus on higher-level work that requires critical thinking, innovation, and collaboration.

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?

### Human answer

> Ask to summary materials, concepts, explanations, and syntax. Avoid code generation and debugging using AI.

### AI (ChatGPT) answer

> When you're learning software development, AI tools can be incredibly helpful in the following ways:

> Code Assistance: Use AI-powered code completion tools like GitHub Copilot or Tabnine to help with code suggestions, syntax, and learning different programming languages.

> Learning New Concepts: AI can help explain complex programming concepts, provide documentation, or guide you through examples, which is great for self-paced learning.

> Debugging Support: AI tools can help identify issues in your code, recommend fixes, and explain errors, making it easier for you to understand mistakes and learn how to avoid them.

> Code Review: You can leverage AI to review your code and suggest improvements or optimizations. This feedback can help you write more efficient and maintainable code.

> Practice Problems: Many platforms use AI to generate coding challenges and assess your solutions, allowing you to practice and improve continuously.

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?

### Human answer

> It is like using drug. I will lose my ability to think critically and clearly. No joke.

### AI (ChatGPT) answer

> While AI tools are powerful, there are a few risks and downsides when using them as a beginner:

> Over-reliance: If you become too dependent on AI tools for writing code, you might miss out on learning important fundamentals, such as algorithms, data structures, and debugging techniques. Understanding the why behind the code is just as important as being able to write it.

> Limited Problem-Solving Skills: If you let AI handle complex problems or code suggestions without thinking critically, you might not develop strong problem-solving skills. The more you code on your own, the better youâ€™ll get at identifying patterns and designing solutions.

> Incomplete Understanding: AI tools can make mistakes, and their suggestions might not always be the most efficient or the best solution. You could end up copying code without fully understanding how it works, which could hinder your long-term growth as a developer.

> False Sense of Mastery: AI tools can make it seem like you're progressing faster than you really are. You may end up using solutions generated by AI without fully grasping the underlying principles, which can slow your development as a programmer.

> To mitigate these risks, it's essential to use AI tools as an assistant or supplement rather than a crutch. Take the time to learn and understand the concepts behind the code, experiment, and gradually build your problem-solving skills. Use AI tools to accelerate your learning process, but make sure you are still engaging with the material and pushing your own boundaries.
