## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?

  > the width of the view port at which the layout is changed.

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?

  > the elements will be responsive to different screen sizes instead of being fixed.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `width` _after_ the styles for a larger `width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `width` will "win". Why is that?
  > CSS run from top-down and overwrite the former styles with the later styles.
